## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Report Writing
1. **Use active voice**: "We implemented" not "It was implemented"
2. **Be specific**: "5.2M pps" not "high throughput"
3. **Cite sources**: Every claim needs a reference
4. **Use diagrams**: A picture is worth 1000 words
5. **Proofread**: Read out loud to catch errors

### Presentation
1. **Start strong**: Hook them with motivation
2. **Tell a story**: Problem → Solution → Results
3. **Use diagrams**: Show, don't just tell
4. **Practice timing**: 15-20 minutes exactly
5. **End with impact**: What did you achieve?

### Viva
1. **Listen carefully**: Understand the question
2. **Think before speaking**: It's okay to pause
3. **Be honest**: "I don't know, but I can research..."
4. **Show enthusiasm**: "That's a great question!"
5. **Connect to project**: Relate answers to your work
